# Cubed

This a small Brownian Dynamics package that is CUDA enabled.

It is suited for hard-sphere simulations by employing a [continuous potential](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5049568).
As of right now it only computes the energy per particle (which should always be close to zero), as well as
the compressibility factor `Z`.
